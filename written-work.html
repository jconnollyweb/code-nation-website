    <h2>
        Unit 1: Improving productivity with IT Unit 1, </h2> 
        <h2>Outcome 1 </h2>
        <h3>1.0 - Start by writing an ‘about me’ section about your background, why you
            decided to come to Code Nation and about your experience so far</h3>
            <p>I have been a pastry chef and in the catering industry since I left school but I have
                been planning on a career change for some time now. When I was offered
                severance in the summer, I thought this would be the perfect time to take the plunge.
                So, I have been practicing coding since then. So, the offer to do a course with Code
                Nation was a no brainer for me.
                I have built my own portfolio with projects Ive built and I'm looking to start applying for some junior front end jobs' soon. 
            </p>
        <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
        <p>IT is vital in modern business. It means you can do business internationally
            instead of just locally. You can message or speak to people across the world as
            easily as speaking to someone in your own city. You can read the market easily
            and target the people you want to do business with or potential customers. You
            can connect with customers much easier too. It’s much more time efficient and
            therefore more cost efficient. Also, it is safer with money transfers.
            Also, using digital safeguards to protect your company from viruses and malware and ransomware are very important to keep your business and customers information and money safe. </p>
         <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital
            projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What
            tools? What skills?</h3>  
            <p>To make a digital project successful you need to have a clear vision of what the
                project is, who is it for and how you are going to achieve that.
                You also need people with a broad scope of skills including coding, you need people to build your code in a professional manner without faults and be responsive on different formats. People with problem solving skills are essential as problems will most definitely arise., you will need organisation skills especially when working in big teams on big projects. Also, people with attention to detail and marketing skills. 
                You also need the correct systems in place for planning, meeting and coding i.e.,
                Trello, Visual studio code and Zoom.</p> 
        <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g., making your website. How will
            you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h3>
            <p>We used Trello and visual studio code to plan and carry out our project.
                Also, when researching we used many different sites to gain knowledge of
                different Python variables that could be used in the game.
                I personally found Stack overflow to be very useful and I watched some
                YouTube tutorials as well.
                Slack was handy for sharing code and ideas with my team mates.
                Here is the link to the project Trello board.

                game-project" target="_blank">

        <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital
            projects to fail? Why?</h3>
        <p>Some of the reasons a project might fail are. Not planning your project
            correctly, maybe being too ambitious. Not managing time correctly and missing
            deadlines. Not learning from past mistakes. Not using your team effectively. Not
            having the right people and right skills in your team. Not taking into account
            laws and guidelines like copyright laws or GDPR for example.
            Things out of your control can happen also like the recent Covid 19 outbreak, loss of personnel  due to illness, businesses closing down permanently or for long enough to have a negative impact.  
        </p>
        <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and
            software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
        <p>I think doing research into what other businesses maybe in a similar field to
            yours would give you an idea of what systems and software you would need to
            complete your project. Also having people with right technical know-how to
            advise on what systems are needed.
            Think about what your business is and how you are going to make it successful
            and decide if the help of experts what tools you’ll need to achieve this.
            Do research on the reviews of the technology you are about to purchase and decide if it’s the correct technology for your project. 
        </p>
        <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have
            helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and
            how can git and GitHub help with your code's version control </h3>
        <p>Trello helped plan my Website stage by stage. It was useful for jotting ideas
            down and putting them in to action. Although I didn’t really need to use it
            during my website it was a lot more useful when making the Python word
            game as I think it is more useful in a group project.
            GitHub is also useful when working in a group project as it keeps track and
            flags up when changes have been made by different members of the team.
            It highlights merge conflicts and prevents work being deleted and lost.
            It is also handy that people can make comments on your code and make
            improvements.</p>    
            <h3>
                1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects –
                How does GDPR impact digital projects?
            </h3>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation are legal guidelines about how
            companies can collect people's personal information to use to the benefit of
            the company. Like understanding trends, targeted advertising.
            Legal guidelines such as GDPR put certain constraints of digital projects as you
            can't get information about your customers so easily. And if you fail to comply
            with the guidelines, you face a heavy penalty
            “All organizations and companies that work with personal data should appoint a data
            protection officer or data controller who is in charge of GDPR compliance.
            There are tough penalties for those companies and organizations who don’t comply
            with GDPR fines of up to 4% of annual global revenue or 20 million Euros,
            whichever is greater”
