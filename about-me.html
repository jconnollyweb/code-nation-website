    <intro>
        <p>I'm John and welcome to my website. It will feature a section about myself, my interests, my goals in web development and why I'm taking part in this course.<br>
        I've been a pastry chef/Baker since I left school and I've had an enjoyable career. But I slowly began to lose the passion for the job and really couldn't see myself in my forties or fifties running around a kitchen so I've been planning a career change for a while now. A few of my friends are working in Web Development and I was impressed with what they had to say about the industry and the rewards. Plus its a ever growing industry with plenty of opportunities and I'd like to get in now whilst the goings good.<br>
        When I was offered severance in the summer I decided this would be the perfect time to take the leap and start training. So I've self teaching myself coding for the last 6 months. Mainly HTML/CSS and a bit of Bootstrap. I've also done a Web Design course with Adobe XD and adding code to my designs.<br>
        I have been learning mostly front end but I would like to become a full stack developer in the future. I would like to become a junior front end developer to start with and get my foot in the door so to speak. <br>
        When the opportunity to take part in this course came around I was very excited as it would be great to get an industry recognised qualification and would be great to meet people who were perhaps going through the same experience as me.
        It has been a challenge at times learning Python, something I've never used before but very satisfying to learn a differnt aspect of coding and getting started on a new skill set<br>
        <br> Outside of coding I enjoy football, running, going out with friends (when allowed) and Rock music, mainly classic rock. This is what my Website will be mainly about.<br>
        I hope you enjoy your stay.</p>
