    <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2 (Review)</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in
        making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g.,
        Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
        <p>I was happy with the tools I used when making my website. I enjoy using visual
            studio code as it's easy to use and I feel comfortable using it. I also know most
            of the shortcuts when using it so it's very time efficient.
            Trello is great for planning and ideas that you'd like to use on your project
            eventually.
            It's very clear and concise about what tasks need to be done and very
            organised and east to read.
            I like the date function also its handy when working towards a deadline.
            It’s also handy if you are working in a team, you can set individual tasks with
            colours and its very clear to all members of the team.
            Here is a link to my Trello board for my website project: 

            <a href="https://trello.com/b/gg0s8wjP/my-website">https://trello.com/b/gg0s8wjP/my-website </a>
        </p>
    <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g., Visual
        Studio Code, Trello</h3>
    <p>Yes, they were appropriate. Although if I were working in a team, I would use
        other tools such as zoom and slack. But as I was working alone visual studio
        code and Trello were adequate.
        Although Trello is a good tool for putting down ideas and then remembering to
        put them into practice.
        Trello was good for planning the tasks that needed to be done step by step and day by day. I think visual studio code is a great tool for coding it's very easy to use and flags mistakes in the code in an easy to read manner. 
        It’s also handy for managing your time efficiently.</p>
    <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you
        happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the
        website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h3>
    <p>Yes, I’m happy with the result of my final project overall. I think it looks good
        and it has met the brief.
        It also works well and all the links work.
        There are a couple of things style wise that I might change style wise. Some of
        the spacing on the page perhaps.
        This is an area of CSS that I need to improve in.
        The images on the page seem to load quite slowly which I think is due to the image size but I would have to look in to that. 
    </p>
    <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h3>
    <p>I would change a couple of things. Maybe get some higher quality images that
        look more attractive on the page.
        Also, the load time was a tad slow, that maybe due to the image sizes.
        This is something I need to look into because it happened on another site I built. 
        I would add some JavaScript and make a Toggle menu and make it more
        responsive with Media Queries.
        I would also use some Php on my contact form.</p>
    <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for
        purpose</h3>
    <p>I think my website meets the requirements. I would perhaps make the contact
        form more functional with a php file attached and would make it responsive to
        mobile and tablet devices.
        The image sizing also made the load time a bit slower.
        I was happy with the video links to YouTube and the Spotify playlists have
        worked quite well, I think.
        I would like to use php and have a fully functioning form page on the contact page. 
    </p>
    <h3>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review)</h3>
    <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms
        of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when
        making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>
    <p>I think I preferred making this website alone as I could use my own ideas and
        the flow of the website was more uniform. I think if a group of people with
        different ideas it would have been a bit of a mish mash and not with one
        theme running through it.
        I do have some experience with CSS though if I was a total beginner working in
        a team would have been beneficial.
        Sharing ideas and solving problems with your teams is always beneficial. 
    </p>
    <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h3>
    <p>I found that making sure code used on multiple pages like a nav menu and
        footer was correct before moving on to other pages. If you copy and paste
        correct code over to other pages it saves a lot of time. If the code is incorrect
        or you need to add changes its very time consuming going though different
        pages of code. Also, selecting the right image files can save a lot of time as its
        quite annoying uploading an image and the scale and pixilation are all wrong.
        Making sure your website is correct and without errors  before uploading it on to GitHub or on to a server is also beneficial 
    </p>
    <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects
        – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h3>
    <p>I think slack would be useful in making sure you have all the correct code in
        place and reminding you of the code you need before you start coding. It
        would stop you having to go back on yourself and editing multiple pages.
        It would also be better for managing your time more effectively by planning
        what needs doing on each day of the project before deadline.
        You could work in a team and share the responsibilities and trouble shoot problems together. Also sharing code and ideas/problems over slack would definitely be more productive. 
    </p>
    <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
    <p>You would have to think about what people will be using your website and
        what your target audience is. What technology or browsers they will be using
        depending on their age or region. You need to test to make sure your project
        can work on all these different devices and that it is compatible with different
        device functions i.e., zooming and page resizing.
        Also, you need to take into account people with disabilities.
        Make sure you test it on people like focus groups and keep up to date with
        current trends in the market.</p>
        <h2>Unit 2: Website Software Unit 2,</h2>
        <h2>Outcome 1</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h3>
        <p>I have made a webpage about myself, my hopes after completing this course
            and my hobbies. I’ve made my website primarily around my favourite rock and
            roll musicians. I have a main page where you can enter the site, an about me
            section and a few pages about my favourite musicians. These pages include a
            brief description about the musician. Some YouTube clips of them performing
            and a link to their Spotify account.
            Ive also got a page for the written work part of the course (this bit) and a
            contact page with links to my GitHub, Portfolio and LinkedIn account.</p>
        <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>
        <p>If you are running a website and intend to make monetary gain from said
            website and you are using someone else’s pictures, writings, videos or music
            you could be breaking copyright laws depending on the owner of said material.
            If the owner made a complaint you would have to remove the content until a
            full investigation had taken place.
            You could always ask permission to use people's creations and pay for the privilege in many cases. If found guilty of breaking copyright law you could face serious action like loss of job, fines or imprisonment in extreme cases.
            “One of the main legal rights created when a website is set up is that of copyright protection under the
            Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988.
            The Act provides copyright protection to any literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, film or broadcast work
            that falls within the Act’s definition of originality when it was created. The creator of an original work
            gains exclusive rights for its use and distribution. The copyright protection is automatic; no formal
            registration of the copyrighted work is required.
            When a website is created copyright protection is likely to exist in relation to:
            • the text of the site – can be protected as a literary work;
            • the pictures on the site – can be protected as either photographic or artistic work;
            • any clips or videos on the site – can be protected as a film and or dramatic work.”
            Ref:<a href=" https://www.inbrief.co.uk/regulations/website-creation-legal-issues/" target="_blank"> https://www.inbrief.co.uk/regulations/website-creation-legal-issues/</a></p>
    <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues
        that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can
        overcome them </h3>
    <p>You need to think of many different types of disabilities when planning on
        making your website usable for everyone.
        You may need to make text bolder for people with poor eyesight. Make sure
        you have alt text on images for people using screen readers.
        Not having flashing images/effects or at least having a warning for people who
        could have seizures or migraines because of them.
        You also have to consider people who cannot use a mouse to navigate around
        the screen. Would handsfree eye tracking and onscreen keyboards work on
        your site.</p>
    <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
    <p>In my experience I have used HTML, CSS, PHP AND JS files saved locally and
        uploaded on to a server or GitHub. I have also used different image formats
        saved in an images folder such as JPG, SVG and PNG depending on what I
        needed the image for. This is quite important as the wrong image file will ruin
        the look of the other all webpage. These all are kept in a main folder of my
        project with the images inside their own folder with the main folder.
        If the images are kept in the main folder with the other files the server will
        struggle to recognise them and they won’t load on your site.</p>
